# week18

FOUNDATIONAL
Spin up two deployments.  One deployment contains 2 pods running the nginx image.  Include a ConfigMap that points to a custom index.html page that contains the line “This is Deployment One”.  The other deployment contains 2 pods running the nginx image.  Include a ConfigMap that points to a custom index.html page that contains the line “This is Deployment Two”.

Create a service that points to both deployments.  You should be able to both deployments using the same ip address and port number.

Hit the refresh button on the web page to validate that you eventual see the index.html pages from both Deployment 1 and Deployment 2.

ADVANCED
Create a Kubernetes persistent storage manifest that gets 250MB of disk space on the host computer in the /temp/k8s directory.   Create a corresponding persistent storage claim manifest file.

COMPLEX
Create a Kubernetes CronJob that spins up both deployments and the service at a specific time.   Test to ensure the CronJob works as expected.
